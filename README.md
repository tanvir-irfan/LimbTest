An upper body exercise game for elderly people.

- Leap Motion used to track hand position and Vive controllers used to track foot position.
- This Virtual Reality game is developed using Unity3D and adapted for both Oculus Rift and HTC Vive.
- I used Head Mounted Display’s (e.g. Oculus Rift, HTC Vive) tracking feature to track head movement and Leap Motion device to track the participant’s hand.
- At first, participant’s reach is calibrated and then the game generates some objects in front of the participant in Virtual Environment and asks to guess whether they can reach the object or not. Based on the answer, (if yes) the participant has five seconds to reach and touch the object. 
- Based on the answers and actions of the participants, I am trying to find out how people’s reach is affected.
